##Server-Side Rendering

-Server Side Rendering. The html data is stored on Server.
-Faster bc data is downloaded directly from server.

###Client-Side Flow

Server sends HTML ready to render > Client/Browser renders HTML,
VIEWABLE! + Downloads JS > Client Executes React > Now Interactive

##Client-Side Rendering

-Client side is what react uses
-Set Back: regular react apps are invisible to bots bc the HTML doesnt exist unless its fetched by a client.

###Client-Side Flow
